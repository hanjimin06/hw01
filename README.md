## Jimin Han 101
My name is **Jimin Han**. \
I am from Korea. *Yes, South not North*.\
My hobby is photography. 
[Here](https://www.instagram.com/jiminhan_photography/) are my photos.  
I hope to become proficient in R after taking this class. \

At first there were some difficulties in doing this assignment: \
1. Forking the HW (Easier than I thought). \
2. Getting the correct directories. \
3. Familiarizing myself with how computers work \
4. My branch was ahead of my master file, so I had to redo. \
5. I hope in the course of few weeks I'll be able to breeze through these 'minor' inconveniences. \
