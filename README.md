## Jimin Han 101
My name is **Jimin Han**. \
I am from Korea. *Yes, South not North*.\
My hobby is photography. 
[Here](https://www.instagram.com/jiminhan_photography/) are my photos.  
I hope to become proficient in R after taking this class. 

At first there were some difficulties in doing this assignment: 
1. Forking the HW (Easier than I thought). 
2. Getting the correct directories. 
3. Familiarizing myself with how computers work 
4. My branch was ahead of my master file, so I had to redo. 
5. I hope in the course of few weeks I'll be able to breeze through these 'minor' inconveniences. 
6.The biggest part was commiting the images. I thought I had done everything right, but as a matter of fact I had not commited the image file itself. That took quite a long time to fix. 

But with help from stack exchange and the TAs, I was able to slowly do all the things listed in the HW. It was a satisfying procedure.
